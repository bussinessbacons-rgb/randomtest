<h1 class="glow-text">The Origin of the Kapre 👹</h1>

<div class="box">
<p>The Kapre comes from pre-colonial Philippine folklore. These tree giants were believed to guard the forests and punish those who disrespected nature. Colonial influences added the glowing cigar and mischievous habits, giving the Kapre his modern look. The legend teaches respect for the environment and fear of the unknown.</p>

<h2 class="glow-text">My Reflection 🌲</h2>

<div class="box">
<p>Reflecting on the Kapre, I realized how folklore blends respect, fear, and imagination. The Kapre warns us to honor nature and the unseen forces around us. It is fascinating that even today, children are taught to respect the forest because of stories like this. Legends preserve culture and teach lessons in a memorable, sometimes creepy way.</p>
